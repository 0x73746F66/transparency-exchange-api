## From product identifier to API endpoint

TEA Discovery is the connection between a product identifier and the API endpoint.
A "product" is something that the customer aquires or downloads. It can be a bundle
of many digital devices or software applications. A "product" normally also has an
entry in a large corporation's asset inventory system.

A product identifier is embedded in a URN where the identifier is one of many existing
identifiers or a random string - like an EAN bar code, UUID, product
number or PURL.

The goal is for a user to add this URN to the transparency platform (sometimes with an
associated authentication token) and have the platform access the required artifacts
in a highly automated fashion.

## Advertising the TEI

The TEI for a product can be communicated to the user in many ways.

- A QR code on a box
- On the invoice or delivery note
- For software with a GUI, in an "about" box

## TEA Discovery - defining an extensible identifier

TEA discovery is the process where a user with a product identifier can discover and downloadg
artifacts automatically, with or without authentication. A globally unique identifier is
required for a given product. This identifier is called the Transparency Exchange Identifier (TEI).

The TEI identifier is based on DNS, which assures a uniqueness per vendor (or open source project)
and gives the vendor a name space to define product identifiers based on existing or new identifiers
ike EAN bar code, PURLs or other existing schemes. A given product may have multiple identifiers
as long as they all resolve into the same destination.

## The TEI URN: An extensible identifier

The TEI, Transparency Exchange Identifier, is a URN schema that is extensible based on existing
identifiers like EAN codes, PURL and other identifiers. It is based on a DNS name, which leads
to global uniqueness without new registries.

The TEI can be shown in the software itself, in shipping documentation, in web pages and app stores.
TEI is unique for a product, not a version of a software. The TEI consist of three core parts

A TEI belongs to a single product. A product can have multiple TEIs - like one with a EAN
barcode and one with the vendor's product number.

### TEI syntax

```text
urn:tei:<type>:<domain-name>:<unique-identifier>
````

- The **`type`** which defines the syntax of the unique identifier part
- The **`domain-name`** part does not have to exist as a web server (HTTPS), but may do
  - The uniqueness of the name is the domain name part that has to be registred at creation of the TEI.
- The **`unique-identifier`** has to be unique within the `domain-name`.
  Recommendation is to use a UUID but it can be an existing article code too

**Note**: this requires a registration of the TEI URN schema with IANA - [see here](https://github.com/CycloneDX/transparency-exchange-api/issues/18)

### TEI types

The below show examples of TEI where the types are specific known formats or types.

Reminder: the `unique-identifer` component of the TEI needs only be unique within the `domain-name`.

#### PURL - Package URL

Where the `unique-identifier` is a PURL in it's canonical string form.

Syntax:

```text
urn:tei:purl:<domain-name>:<purl>
````

Example:
```text
urn:tei:purl:cyclonedx.org:pkg:pypi/cyclonedx-python-lib@8.4.0?extension=whl&qualifier=py3-none-any
```

#### SWID

Where the `unique-identifier` is a SWID.

Syntax:

```text
urn:tei:swid:<domain-name>:<swid>
````

Note that there is a TEI SWID type as well as a PURL SWID type.

#### HASH

Where the `unique-identifier` is a Hash. Supports the following hash types:

* SHA256
* SHA384
* SHA512

```text
urn:tei:hash:<domain-name>:<hashtype>:<hash>
````

Example:
```text
urn:tei:hash:cyclonedx.org:SHA256:fd44efd601f651c8865acf0dfeacb0df19a2b50ec69ead0262096fd2f67197b9
```

The origin of the hash is up to the vendor to define.

#### UUID

Where the `unique-identifier` is a UUID.

Syntax:

```text
urn:tei:uuid:<domain-name>:<uuid>
````

Example:
```text
urn:tei:uuid:cyclonedx.org:d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1
```


#### Other types to be defined

- EAN
- GS1
- STD

### TEI resolution using DNS

The name part of the TEI is used in a DNS query to find one or multiple locations for
product transparency exchange information. DNS can deliver load balancing and
failover functionality to make sure that the information is always reachable.

At the URL we need a well-known name space to find out where the API endpoint is hosted.
This is solved by using the ".well-known" name space as defined by the IETF.

- `urn:tei:uuid:products.example.com:d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1`
- Syntax: `urn:tei:uuid:<name based on domain>:<unique identifier>`

The name in the DNS name part points to a set of DNS records.
A TEI with name â€œtea.example.com" queries for `tea.example.com HTTPS records.
These point to the hosts available for the Transparency Exchange API.
Note that "tea.example.com" may not have A/AAAA records at all if it
points to other servers, like "tea01.example.org" and "teahost.example.net".

If there are no HTTPS records, try to resolve the name (using AAAA and A DNS records).

After selecting a host and resolving that to IP address, the TEA client
connects to the host using HTTPS with the original name, not the one found
in DNS. The URI is composed of the name with the  "/.well-known/tea" prefix added.

```text
tea.example.com.   3600 IN HTTPS  1  tea01.prod.example.com.
```

Results in `https://tea.example.com/.well-known/tea/<identifier>` while connecting to
the host tea01.prod.example.com.

### Load balancing and fail over

Example zone:

```text
tea.example.com.   3600 IN HTTPS  10  tea01.prod.example.com.
tea.example.com.   3600 IN HTTPS  10  tea02.prod.example.com.
tea.example.com.   3600 IN HTTPS  20  tea03.prod.example.com.
```

In this case servers tea01 and tea02 will get 50% of the load each.
If they are not reachable, tea03 will be used for failover.

It is recommended to have a third party external repository as the last priority.

## Connecting to the API

When connecting to the ".well-known/tea" URI with the unique identifier
a HTTP redirect is **required**.

The server MUST redirect HTTP requests for that resource
to the actual "context path" using one of the available mechanisms
provided by HTTP (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response).  Clients
MUST handle HTTP redirects on the ".well-known" URI.  Servers MUST
NOT locate the actual TEA service endpoint at the
".well-known" URI as per Section 1.1 of [RFC5785].

### Overview: Finding the Index using DNS result

Append the product part of the TEI to the URI found

- TEI: `urn:tei:uuid:products.example.com:d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1`
- DNS record: `products.example.com`
- Server found in DNS HTTPS record: `teapot.prod.example.com`
- URL: `https://products.example.com/.well-known/tea/d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1/`
- HTTP 302 redirect to "https://teapot02.consumer.example.com/tea/v2/product-index/d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1'

The server at "teapot.prod.example.com" needs a TLS certificate including "products.example.com"
in the subject alt name. "teapot02.consumer.example.com" needs a certificate with that
host name.

If no HTTPS records are found the resolution defaults to A and AAAA records.
IP address is not valid in the domain name field.

Append the URL prefix `/.well-known/tea/` of the TEI to the DNS name found
Always prefix with the https:// scheme. http (unencrypted) is not valid.

- TEI: `urn:tei:uuid:products.example.com:d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1`
- URL: `https://products.example.com/.well-known/tea/d4d9f54a-abcf-11ee-ac79-1a52914d44b1/`

**NOTE:** The `/.well-known/tea`names space needs to be registred.

## The TEA Version Index

The resulting URL leads to the TEA version index, which is documented in another document.
One redirect (302) is allowed in order to provide for aliasing, where a single product
has many identifiers. The redirect should not lead to a separate web server.
